# FigTree analysis

<b>Python scripts for FigTree-based phylogenetic analysis pipelines.</b>

# Introduction

This repository contains useful Python2 scripts to help with phylogenetic analysis in FigTree. FigTree is a graphical viewer for phylogenetic trees that I find useful for interpretting phylogenies and manually annotating OTUs. This is particularly useful when examining species phylogenies, removing contaminations and paralogs during phylogenomic analyses, and identifying genes or proteins of interest for comparative genomics. 

FigTree was developed by Andrew Rambaut and is available from: https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases

Scripts for easily making annotation files and extracting or removing sequences are included.
